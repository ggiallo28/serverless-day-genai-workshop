    "## Building, Deploying, Connecting, Optimizing, and Extending AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows the full lifecycle of creating an advanced AI agent using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and Strands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Local Agent Development\n",
    "Build a simple Strands Agent, add small tools, and run it locally.  \n",
    "This is the fast, iterative phase where the agent’s core behavior is validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Preparing for Runtime Deployment\n",
    "Wrap the agent with an AgentCore Runtime entrypoint, generate a container, deploy it, and invoke it.  \n",
    "The agent becomes a managed, scalable service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Introducing AgentCore Gateway\n",
    "Gateway provides secure access to external tools, identity isolation, protocol translation, and built-in tool search.  \n",
    "It becomes essential when the agent must interact with many services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Creating Gateways and Adding Tools\n",
    "Create a Gateway, configure identity, register tools and schemas, expose APIs, and scale up to large tool catalogs.  \n",
    "The Gateway acts as the unified tool layer for the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Semantic Tool Search\n",
    "Instead of giving the agent hundreds of tools, use natural language search to retrieve only the relevant ones.  \n",
    "This reduces complexity and boosts accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Using Gateway Tools Inside a Strands Agent\n",
    "Integrate the Gateway with the agent.  \n",
    "Use either the full toolset or only the search-filtered subset.  \n",
    "Dynamic tool selection leads to cleaner reasoning and fewer errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Performance and Token Savings\n",
    "Compare two styles:\n",
    "- an agent with all tools  \n",
    "- an agent using only search-selected tools  \n",
    "\n",
    "Search-based selection consistently reduces latency, token usage, and reasoning overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Adding Memory\n",
    "Add AgentCore Memory with a summary strategy and custom hooks.  \n",
    "The agent retrieves relevant past context and stores new interactions automatically.  \n",
    "This enables personalization and continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Conclusion\n",
    "The final agent:\n",
    "- runs locally and in Runtime  \n",
    "- uses Gateway for tool access  \n",
    "- picks tools intelligently through search  \n",
    "- performs faster with fewer tokens  \n",
    "- remembers past interactions through Memory  \n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a complete, practical blueprint for production-grade AI agents."

    "### Tutorial Architecture\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway provides unified connectivity between agents and the tools and resources they need to interact with. Gateway plays multiple roles in this connectivity layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Security Guard**: Gateway manages OAuth authorization to ensure only valid users / agents access tools / resources.\n",
    "2. **Translator**: Gateway translates agent requests made using popular protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) into API requests and Lambda invocations. This means developers don’t need to host servers, manage protocol integration, version support, version patching, etc.\n",
    "3. **Composer**: Gateway enables developers to seamlessly combine multiple APIs, functions, and tools into a single MCP  endpoint that an agent can use.\n",
    "4. **Keychain**: Gateway handles the injection of the right credentials to use with the right tool, ensuring that agents can seamlessly leverage tools that require different sets of credentials. \n",
    "5. **Researcher**: Gateway enables agents to search across all of their tools to find only the ones that are best for a given context or question. This allows agents to make use of 1000s of tools instead of just a handful. It also minimizes the set of tools that need to be provided in an agent’s LLM prompt, reducing latency and cost. \n",
    "6. **Infrastructure Manager**: Gateway is completely serverless, and comes with built-in observability and auditing, alleviating the need for developers to manage additional infrastructure to integrate their agents and tools. \n",

    "## AgentCore Gateway helps solve the challenge of MCP servers that have large numbers of tools\n",
    "In a typical enterprise setting, agent builders encounter MCP servers that have hundreds or even thousands\n",
    "of MCP tools. This volume of tools poses challenges for AI agents, including poor tool selection accuracy, \n",
    "increased cost, and higher latency driven by higher token usage from excessive tool metadata.\n",
    "This can happen when connecting your agents to third party services (e.g., Zendesk, Salesforce,\n",
    "Slack, JIRA, ...), or to existing enterprise REST services. \n",
    "AgentCore Gateway provides a built in semantic search across tools, \n",
    "which improves agent latency, cost, and accuracy, while still giving those agents the tools they need. \n",
    "Depending on your use case, LLM model, and agent framework, you can see up to 3x better latency by keeping\n",
    "an agent focused on relevant tools versus providing the full set of hundreds of tools from a typical MCP Server.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you create an AgentCore Gateway, you have the option to indicate that you want Search enabled.\n",
    "For Gateways with search enabled, three things happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector store is created**. The Gateway service automatically creates a serverless fully-managed vector store for your new Gateway. This enables a full semantic search across your Gateway tools. \n",
    "3. **Vector store is populated**. As you add Gateway Targets to your Gateway, the service automatically uses embeddings behind the scenes to populate the vector store based on the tools from the new Target. The tool metadata comes from the JSON defintions of your tools or the OpenAPI Schema specification for your REST services targets.\n",
    "2. **Search tool (MCP based) is provided**. In addition to all of your user defined tools (from AWS Lambda targets or REST services), the Gateway gets one additional MCP tool that provides semantic search. It is named `x-amz-bedrock-agentcore-search`. The prefix ensures there are no name clashes with your user-defined tools. We may add more tools like that in the future as well. The search tool has a single argument called `query`. When the search tool is invoked, the Gateway service performs a semantic search using that query, matching it against available tool metadata (names, descriptions, input and output schema), and returns the most relevant tools in descending order of relevance."

    "AgentCore Gateway provides a secure and scalable way to expose a curated set of existing APIs\n",
    "as MCP tools for your agents. In a production setting, your Gateway resources would be created\n",
    "using infrastructure as code with tools like CloudFormation, CDK, or Terraform. In this tutorial,\n",
    "we use the boto3 control plane APIs directly, so that you can understand the resources and APIs more effectively.\n",
    "This will help you more easily get started building and using your own gateways, and making more powerful\n",
    "and secure agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the steps for setting up your Gateway are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define what identity providers and credential providers you are using for inbound (agents calling Gateways) and outbound (Gateways calling tools) security.\n",
    "2. Create the Gateway using `create_gateway`.\n",
    "3. Add Gateway Targets using `create_gateway_target`, to expose MCP tools that will be implemented in AWS Lambda or in existing RESTful services.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use Amazon Cognito as the identity provider (IdP), AWS Lambda functions as targets, and AWS IAM for outbound authentication. The same concepts demonstrated in this tutorial still apply when using other IdP's or other target types."

To prove the point, we use two different topics: math (adding numbers), and food (booking a restaurant reservation), each requiring a different set of tools.\n",

    "- how to use the built-in semantic search tool to find relevant tools\n",

    "AgentCore Gateway search is helpful for more advanced use cases as well. By offering the search as a native\n",
